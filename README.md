# Deep Thoughts

*Here's a thought...*

Deep Thoughts is a social media platform somewhat like Tumblr, where users can post "thoughts", add comments, called reactions, to other people's thoughts, and mark each-other as friends. Deep Thoughts makes use of a React frontend and a backend built with Apollo, Express, and GraphQL, which connects to a Mongo database. View it live at https://deep-thoughts-fs.herokuapp.com/.

Deep Thoughts was created as an assignment for the Washington University Coding Bootcamp, and makes use of starter code provided by the school.
